Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]

void sort(vector<int> &arr) {
    // all elements < low are 0 and all elements > high are 2
    // all elements from >= low < i are 1
    int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i <= high;) {
      if (arr[i] == 0) {
        swap(arr, i, low);
        i++;
        low++;
      } else if (arr[i] == 1) {
        i++;
      } else {  // the case for arr[i] == 2
        swap(arr, i, high);
        // decrement 'high' only, after the swap the number at index 'i' could be 0, 1 or 2
        high--;
      }
    }

    Time complexity #
    The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we are iterating the input array only once.

    Space complexity #
    The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
