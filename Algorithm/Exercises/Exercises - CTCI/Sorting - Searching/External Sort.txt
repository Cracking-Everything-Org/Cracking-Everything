Sort Big File: Image you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file.


Solution:

When an interviwer gives a size limit of 20 gigabytes, it should tell you something. In this case, it suggests
that they don't want you to bring all the data into memory.

So what do we do? We only bring part of the data into memory.

We'll divide the file into chunks, which are x megabytes each, where x is the amount of memory we have
available. Each chunk is sorted separately and then saved back to the file system.

Once all the chunks are sorted, we merge the chunks, one by one. At the end, we have a fully sorted file.

This algorithm is known as external sort.
