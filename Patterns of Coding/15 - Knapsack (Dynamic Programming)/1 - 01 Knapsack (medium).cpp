Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’. Each item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.


class Knapsack {
 public:
  int solveKnapsack(const vector<int> &profits, vector<int> &weights, int capacity) {
    // basic checks
    if (capacity <= 0 || profits.empty() || weights.size() != profits.size()) {
      return 0;
    }

    int n = profits.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(capacity + 1));

    // populate the capacity=0 columns, with '0' capacity we have '0' profit
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      dp[i][0] = 0;
    }

    // if we have only one weight, we will take it if it is not more than the capacity
    for (int c = 0; c <= capacity; c++) {
      if (weights[0] <= c) {
        dp[0][c] = profits[0];
      }
    }

    // process all sub-arrays for all the capacities
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      for (int c = 1; c <= capacity; c++) {
        int profit1 = 0, profit2 = 0;
        // include the item, if it is not more than the capacity
        if (weights[i] <= c) {
          profit1 = profits[i] + dp[i - 1][c - weights[i]];
        }
        // exclude the item
        profit2 = dp[i - 1][c];
        // take maximum
        dp[i][c] = max(profit1, profit2);
      }
    }

    // maximum profit will be at the bottom-right corner.
    return dp[n - 1][capacity];
  }
};


int solveKnapsack(const vector<int> &profits, vector<int> &weights, int capacity) {
    // base checks
    if (capacity <= 0 || profits.empty() || weights.size() != profits.size()) {
      return 0;
    }

    int n = profits.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(capacity + 1));

    // populate the capacity=0 columns, with '0' capacity we have '0' profit
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      dp[i][0] = 0;
    }

    // if we have only one weight, we will take it if it is not more than the
    // capacity
    for (int c = 0; c <= capacity; c++) {
      if (weights[0] <= c) {
        dp[0][c] = profits[0];
      }
    }

    // process all sub-arrays for all the capacities
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      for (int c = 1; c <= capacity; c++) {
        int profit1 = 0, profit2 = 0;
        // include the item, if it is not more than the capacity
        if (weights[i] <= c) {
          profit1 = profits[i] + dp[i - 1][c - weights[i]];
        }
        // exclude the item
        profit2 = dp[i - 1][c];
        // take maximum
        dp[i][c] = max(profit1, profit2);
      }
    }

    printSelectedElements(dp, weights, profits, capacity);
    // maximum profit will be at the bottom-right corner.
    return dp[n - 1][capacity];
  }


Time and Space complexity #
Since our memoization array dp[profits.length][capacity+1] stores the results for all subproblems, we can conclude that we will not have more than N*C subproblems (where ‘N’ is the number of items and ‘C’ is the knapsack capacity). This means that our time complexity will be O(N*C).

The above algorithm will use O(N*C) space for the memoization array. Other than that we will use O(N) space for the recursion call-stack. So the total space complexity will be O(N*C + N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N*C).
